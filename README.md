# 100 Little Keg Exercises
_A way to learn Keg through practical exercises_

Uninteractive tutorials are hard. So is trying to read the raw source code for a language. So why not learn Keg through completing 100 little exercises designed to improve and teach the features of the language?

Each exercise has a question file and an answer file. It is reccomended that you don't read the answer file until you have solved the question yourself.

## Assumed Knowledge

These things are assumed:

1. That you know how to program/that you are able to practice what I call "algorithmtic thinking"

When I say this, I mean that you can fluently use other programming languages, whether esoteric or practical. In other words, knowing something like Python, 05AB1E, W or Java will be helpful. Knowing languages like Deadfish, HQ9+, etc, _probably_ won't be very helpful.

2. That you have some sort of knowledge about what stacks are.

If y'all need a little explanation about what and how stacks work, I suggest you read about how they work, as the main method of data interaction in Keg is using a main stack. Some information can be found [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Stack) on Esolangs.

These things aren't assumed:

- That you've had any interaction with Keg. In other words, you can be completely new to Keg, or you can be a Keg master (like [@A-ee](https://github.com/A-ee), who is somehow always able to find ways to golf my Keg programs).

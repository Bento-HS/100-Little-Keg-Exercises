# Addition of Two Letters

One of the most common problems solved when learning a new language is to add two numbers. Throughout this exercise, you will learn about:

- Autopushing
- The `+` operator
- The input operator
- Output methods

## The Challenge

I want you to write a program that:

- Takes a single letter as input
- Push the letter `A`
- Add the ascii value of the input to the ascii value of `A`
- Output the result as an integer

You will need to know these things:

- Alphanumerical characters are automatically pushed onto the stack
- `?` is used to take input as characters
- `.` prints the top of the stack as an integer
- `+` works in a RPN format.
